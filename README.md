# Todo List App
A simple todo list app written in React Native (TypeScript).

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

Start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

```bash
npm start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

In the same running terminal, select the appropriate device type (Android or iOS).

```bash
# for Android
a

# for iOS
i
```

## Future Improvements
- Use React Context to store global state to prevent need to fetch data on every page navigation
- Offline access and reconciliation
- More fluid loading behaviour
